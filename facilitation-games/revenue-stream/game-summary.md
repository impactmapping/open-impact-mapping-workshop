# Game Name: Revenue Stream

One of the key problems facing teams new to impact mapping is jumping too fast from perceived outcomes to solutions, without considering the variety of actors involved or the multitude of solution options that could lead to the same outcome. In particular, teams often do not consider actors or stakeholders that could hinder or obstruct the progress towards the goal (such as competitors, regulators, platform providers with their own agendas). 

The objective of this game is to promote divergent thinking and explicitly force teams to consider different types of actors, by avoiding the discussion on solutions, and considering the different forces in play that could impact the progress towards an organisational goal.

## Objective

Generate a wide list of potential actors/stakeholders to consider for an impact map; provide alignment and a big picture view for everyone involved in planning.

## Key metaphor

This game uses a metaphor of a living city for an organisation, and particularly the growth/sustainability of a city as a metaphor for the progress of an organisation towards its goals/objectives. 

The city gets clean water from rivers, flowing into the city. Clean water is necessary for growth and sustainability of the citizens. Those rivers represent revenue streams and channels that need to grow or be sustainable in order for the organisation to succeed. Rivers break down into tributaries that represent customer groups, users, stakeholders and actors contributing to individual revenue streams. Those groups can then be hierarchically broken into further segments, based on the strategy and market position of the organisation.

The city is in danger from two types of pollution: direct polluters (who dump dirty water into one of the revenue streams or tributaries), and air polluters. The first group represents stakeholders and actors that directly block or reduce progress. The second group represents actors/stakeholder who are not immediately endangering a specific revenue stream but could turn out to be problem in the future.

## Structure

This is a group exercise around a large sheet of paper, flipchart or whiteboard, and all participants are encouraged to draw simultaneously. Group sizes of 5-6 should allow for good discussion and divergent thinking. Each group should have a large paper to draw on, and various colour marker pens. Avoid ball pens because the writing will be difficult to read from distance. 

This game can either be played in cabaret style seating where the papers are placed on table tops, or with participants standing next to a flipchart/paper stuck on a wall.

Because this game is aimed to facilitate divergent thinking, and uses uses a rich visual metaphor, don't be too strict on participants if they go off script and start adding additional ways for the city to flourish or be in danger.

Avoid erasable whiteboards if possible, because it's important to keep discarded ideas as well to inspire further divergent thinking.

The game evolves through three diverge/merge cycles, with groups working individually during the divergent phase, and then reviewing results together during the merging phase.

Divergent phases should be timeboxed to 15-20 minutes, to allow for groupwork and discussions. During divergent phases, participants work in individual groups, draw on their group paper sheet and add ideas.

Merging phases should be timeboxed to 10 minutes. The purpose of the merge phases is to inspire other groups to come up with additional ideas by reviewing progress so far. When working with 2-3 groups, it is best to review the individual group results one at a time, with one participant from each group presenting to the whole room. When working with more than 3 groups, just get people to walk around and read through the other group results in a time-boxed review after each divergent cycle.

## Process

### Preparation

* Frame the goals for the participants (for example, getting one of the senior stakeholders to present the objectives for the next milestone). 
* Explain the key challenge of coming up with various different types of stakeholders, and the metaphor of the city supplied by clean air and water
* Show an example of a Revenue Stream game outcome

### First divergent session - primary actors

Get the participants to draw a city in the middle of their paper sheet. Then ask them to draw streams of bringing clean water to the city, representing various revenue/contribution channels, and break those into tributaries representing individual stakeholder/actor groups. They can continue breaking those down into tributaries for customer/stakeholder segments.

Encourage participants to use line thickness to signify importance

### Second divergent session - secondary actors and obstructions

Get the participants to draw water polluting factories. These represent stakeholders/actors that can directly obstruct/hinder/damage the progress towards the goal. Invite participants to revisit each stream/tributary and think of actors or stakeholders who could prevent the progress. It's perfectly OK to revisit and add more revenue streams/tributaries if they can think of them, but the key focus should be on potential obstructions. 

### Third divergent session - off-stage actors

Get the participants to draw air polluting factories, that represent actors/stakeholders who are not directly polluting the revenue streams, but need to be watched as their behaviour might change and impact the objectives negatively. Examples are service providers that could change prices, revoke critical services etc).

### Concluding merge session

With intermittent merging sessions between drawing, the final maps should converge towards a common set of stakeholders, so there should be no major need for a big closing merge/discussion session. The artefacts produced from this workshop can be directly used as an input into follow-up exercises and facilitation games.

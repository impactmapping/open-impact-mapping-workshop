# Impact Trump Cards 

The purpose of this facilitation game is to spark divergent, creative thinking about impacts and behaviour changes that
various stakeholder groups can have on an organisational initiative, that will finally be mapped as an impact map.

The best time to run this is before drawing the first draft of the impact map.

# Game Name: Impact Trump Cards 

A major stumbling block for people new to impact mapping is misunderstanding impacts, and treating deliverables (for example, 'mobile sales application') or user behaviour ('buying using a mobile app') as impacts. The most effective way to capture impacts is with behaviour changes (for example, 'buying _faster_'), because that provides a dimension of measurement (for example, '_how much faster?_') and several possible ways of dividing the target into smaller targets (smaller scale of change, or change to a smaller segment of actors). 

The objective of this game is to promote divergent thinking and inspire teams to consider different ways stakeholders can impact the organisational objectives, helping groups to come up with a better definition of the problem before diving into designing a solution. 

People can often get a list of changes such as doing something faster, slower, more or less quickly. This game encourages them to go further. 

## Objective

Generate a list of potential impacts to consider for an impact map; secondary objective is to expand the list of stakeholders.

## Structure

This is an exercise for a small group (4-6) of participants. Larger groups of people can be split into several smaller groups, with a final discussion that brings all the results together. Ideally, make each group contain an even number of participants, so that a voting session will always produce a majority (with four people in the group, three participants will vote on the proposed cards of the fourth person -- an odd number of people voting ensures that there is a clear decision). 

This is a competitive game, in which points are awarded for creativity and thinking out of the box, similar to the classic card trump games. Each group should sit around a table (ideally cabaret style seating), and the participants simultaneously create playing cards, arrange them in stacks, and compete to collect stacks of cards. 

## Facilities/Materials required

The participants will work in groups of 4-6. Each group should have:

- a table to sit around - ideally cabaret style seating
- a set of pre-printed [card templates](handouts/card-templates.doc) #broken link
- ball pens or thin marker pens. Avoid thick markers or flipchart pens because the participants will not be able to write with them clearly on the cards
- a pack of blu-tack or some other light adhesive
- enough space to move around the table/flipchart unobstructed by other groups.


Each participant will need a [cheat sheet](handouts/cheat-sheet.doc) #broken link

The facilitator will need a projector, and a projection screen/wall clearly visible to all the participants from the tables where they will sit. Avoid rooms with pillars blocking the view to the main projection space.

For coordinating discussions, you'll need one large sheet of paper or a wall area where the participants can stick cards with blu-tack
## Pre-requisites

This game requires the facilitators to prepare:

- a clear objective that the participants will discuss (organisational goal, product milestone goal etc), ideally backed up by a clear business case
- an initial set of actors that could help or hinder the progress towards the objective. 
  - the list of actors should ideally be on a slide, or split across several slides, so you can introduce them easily and change/rewrite based on the feedback from the room.
  - the participants will work through the list one actor at a time, so prioritise it based on importance.
  - the actors on the list should ideally represent groups with similar behaviours/needs. 
    - avoid segments that are only useful to narrow down the scope of work (for example, choosing customers in a single location is a perfectly valid way to reduce the scope of work for the initial release, but unless the segment for a single location has significantly different needs/behaviours, group all such segments together for this game).
    - avoid overly generic categories (eg 'customers' or 'users'), try to be specific about the category or segment of users that will help the participants identify the critical behaviours/needs
    - try creating a [Revenue Stream Map](../revenue-stream-map) to explore the actors

## Process

The participants will play the game in rounds, one round per actor/stakeholder group. It's important that everyone works on the same actors, to facilitate a good discussion and provide focus. Rounds should play fairly quickly, and you should organise a coordinating discussion at the end of each round.  

### Preparation

Introduce the business objective and the initial set of actors, then choose one less significant actor group and play a demonstration round with a few participants in front of the whole room, explaining the process. Make sure to point out the following:
* Trumping rules
* Voting rules
* It's perfectly OK to add new cards during the game
* It's nice to think about additional actors during the game, but encourage participants to just write them down and report later and focus on the task at hand

Hand out the cheat sheets and card templates to the groups, and again introduce the first actor group that they will work on. 

### First block in a round - writing cards

Ask the participants to silently and individually create as many cards as they can for the chosen actor group, by filling in behaviour changes. Point out the examples on the cheat-sheet and explain the common failures (deliverables or just behaviours).

Time-box this block to no more than ten minutes. If you have a lot of stakeholder groups to go through, make this session shorter.

### Second block in a round - trumping 

Each group chooses one person to start the game. The starting person chooses one of their cards and puts face up on the table, in the middle of the group, starting a new stack. The game continues clock-wise, with each person trying to trump the card currently on the top of the stack. The rest of the group votes quickly whether they accept or reject the card (for example, showing thumbs up/down). 

One player can only place one card at a time, the next participant clockwise plays after. If a participant does not have any cards that can trump the current top of the stack, the next participant clockwise plays.

It's perfectly fine to write new cards during the trumping session, as long as that does not hold up the game. Ask the participants to write the cards while the others are playing. 

When no participants have any additional cards, the last person to place the card on top of the stack wins the whole stack. The winning player earns one point for each card on the stack (this is to encourage people trumping a big stack with more ideas). If the last remaining player is left with additional cards after all the other participants have spent their cards, they can add all the remaining cards to the top of the stack, increasing the number of points received, but the group needs to vote on each of those cards as well and accept/reject them.

The winning player then moves the stack to the side, and the group has finished a single round of the game. They can observe the other groups until everyone completes the round. 

#### Trumping rules

A card can trump another card if:

  * it is related to the same actor but a different behaviour change
  * the same behaviour change was not used before 
  * the behaviour change can plausibly impact the key objective/goal set out before the game
  * the rest of the group accepts it by majority vote

The magnitude or importance of behaviour changes is irrelevant. Some players assume that that a card can only be trumped with a more significant behaviour change, so it's worth pointing this out. The idea is to promote divergent thinking, so any plausible idea is worth considering.

#### Voting rules

Once a player places a card on the top of the stack, the rest of the group quickly votes on it:
  * make sure it's plausible 
  * make sure it's a behaviour change
  * make sure it's not been mentioned before

###Â End of round - coordinating discussion 

Get the winners to sum up the points, and declare the overall winner for the round.

Draw up a set of quadrants on a big sheet of paper, or a whiteboard, and get the group to cluster and organise ideas. This is the convergent part of the exercise, where the group discards duplicates and chooses the first set of impacts to deal with. 

The horizontal axis should reflect how much a behaviour change can help or hinder the initiative (eg left side for obstructions, right side for helpful behaviour changes, and distance from the centre reflects expected magnitude of impact).  

The vertical axis reflects how quickly the impact can be observed (soon or late).

Ask the participants if they would like to propose any new actors to add to the list.

### End of the game

The game ends when there are no more rounds to play -- you've explored all the important actor groups.

### Points at the end

The purpose of "winning" the stack in the game is to add a competitive element which will promote divergent thinking and speed up the game, but it may also be nice to declare a final winner at the end and award a symbolic trophy, such as a chocolate bar.

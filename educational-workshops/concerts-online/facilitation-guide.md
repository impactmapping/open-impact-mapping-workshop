# Facilitation guide

This guide explains how to facilitate the 'Concerts Online' impact mapping educational workshop. It is intended for consultants, trainers and team leaders that want to introduce impact mapping into an organisation. **This is not a guide for participants, and should not be shared with anyone apart from the facilitators**. See the [Logistics Guide](logistics-guide.md) for information regarding participant documents.

## Workshop variants

This workshop can run either as a half-day or a full-day session. The half-day variant is faster paced and better as a motivational session. The full-day variant allows for more discussion time and several additional exercises, so it provides more hands-on experience. You can run this workshop as a separate session, or include it into a larger workshop (for example, a two-day product owner course). If you decide to mix 'Concerts Online' with a larger workshop, it should come ideally after a session on determining business objectives/goals and before a session on detailed user stories or techniques to deal with individual backlog items.

The half-day session requires relatively punctual timing, especially for group discussions, so you'll have to drive the groups towards the right conclusions. The key points that the participants are supposed to reach are listed in the exercise guides. In the full-day variant you should let the discussions go on for longer, and may potentially remove the last exercise if the schedule slips. 

### Half-day guideline timings

For illustrative purposes, this assumes that the workshop starts at 9AM. Adjust accordingly for an afternoon session.

## Group considerations

The participants will work in groups, straight from the start. The ideal group size is 4-5 participants. Avoid larger groups as they tend to create too much internal discussion, and it's easy for some people to tune out in a larger group. Ideally, arrange for groups to contain people who do not typically work together - they are either from different teams or different organisations. For a half-day variant, let the people stay in the same group. That will save time and allow for closer groupwork. For the full-day variant, consider shuffling groups between exercises to allow for more varied opinions and break monotony. 

With less than 20 people in the room (so up to 3-4 groups), you can run discussion sessions by getting each group to present their work in turn. With more groups, this will take too much time. Instead of each group presenting, give people five minutes at the start of each discussion session to walk around the room and see the results produced by other groups, then lead the discussion by pointing out the key ideas on various solutions.

This workshop works best up to 30-40 people, although you can also do it with a much larger group if their expectations are just to get a nice taste of impact maps. Gojko once led a workshop with about 150 people at a conference based on the half-day variant. In the case of a very large group, it's best to have several facilitators, and run the discussion sessions as a public conversation between facilitators ('I noticed in this group....'). 

## Exercise guides

### Exercise 1: Initial Plans

This is a warm-up exercise. In the 'Training from the back of the room' terminology, it is a Connections-type exercise. The objective is give the participants a bit of time to form groups, connect their current knowledge to the problem, and learn about the exercise business domain. Also, the exercise helps to provide a baseline that you can use for comparison later, after the [Propose new delivery plans](#exercise-5-propose-new-delivery-plans) exercise.

#### Facilitation Goal

Get groups to create several different plans. 

#### Learning Objective

This exercise is a set-up for later exercises, there is no particular learning objective.

#### Mechanics

Start by explaining the purpose of the exercise. As far as the participants are concerned, _this is to provide a common baseline they can use for later comparison_. 

Next, introduce introducing the 'Concerts Online' company. You can show the first two slides from the [Exercises](slides/exercises.ppt) presentation while introducing the domain. Here are the key points to talk about:

* First slide
  * This is a successful business, with a horrible legacy system
  * We have cash and people to deliver software, but so far legacy rewrites ended up in a bin, as they could never catch up with the new system
  * The web site is optimised for desktop web browsers (eg lots of Flash), no longer providing a competitive advantage, moving too slowly
  * Unless we can respond to market changes quickly, one of our competitors will destroy us

* Second slide
  * The key user segment are teenagers/young adults, mostly using mobile devices and hanging out on social networks
  * Most of the money comes from selling tickets, second most important money source is advertising, then selling random merchandise related to concerts
  * We sell three types of tickets:
    * some are exclusive, eg a massively popular performer coming to London, we can negotiate an exclusive distribution deal to be the only site selling tickets (so we can't improve by selling more, but we can mess things up by not selling enough and losing exclusive deals) 
    * some are shared with other sales organisation (so the more we sell, the more money comes in)
    * some are self-service; smaller bands can set up a ticket sales channel through us via the events admin app, we take a profit cut. This is a relatively new, but very promising revenue stream for us.
  * The most popular content are artist pages. Eg Britney Spears page will have some videos, news, links to songs and upcoming concert info on Britney. For hugely popular artists, we have deals with their PR agencies posting content. For some small groups, they post it themselves. The parts in the middle are automatically generated from news feeds, content aggregators, web scraping and so on. This is also one of our key pieces of software, because it provides search engines with lots of material so they send us users.
  * The second most popular content are location pages (eg what's on in London tonight). For larger cities, we have content editors working on the materials. For smaller locations, our automated content systems do the work.

The last part (talking about sales percentages, revenue streams, popular pages) is important because it provides slight misdirection. The participants will wrongly assume that preserving the key business stream -- ticket sales -- is the critical thing in this and the next few exercises, which will provide a nice opportunity to discuss how bad assumptions about goals create problems for iterative delivery.

Now, introduce the challenge. You are the marketing director, and you just got the budget approval for a complete rewrite to support the business for the next 10 years. And naturally, it's going to be mobile. _Show the third slide_ -- the first order of business is to create an iPhone app. The groups are product management teams, and they need to propose the roadmap for building the app. We don't want to wait for two years to get something out, but instead want to deliver it iteratively. The teams should propose the plans for the next 4-5 iterations. Say that you will go around to answer any business questions they might have, but it's their responsibility to come up with a plan. _Switch to the second slide, showing the profit channels/customer breakdown_. 

When talking to the groups, do not address the entire room - answer questions only to individual groups. This will help groups create divergent plans. Avoid commenting on anything as good/bad. Explain that it's their job to propose the plans, and then they'll get a chance to compare them. Here are some of the most typical questions that the people will ask, and how to respond:

* _What's the most important thing for the business?_ - We have to migrate everything at some point, so everything is "most important", but you do not know how much they can deliver quickly, so it's up to them to propose a plan. If they insist on an answer, point them to the slide with revenue streams and say that starting anywhere with the key channels is good.
* _Why an iPhone app, why not Android?_ - So we can deliver iteratively; Android will be phase 2 once we have a successful iPhone app; People with iPhones spend more money through mobile phones. Our key stakeholders/managers all have iPhones.
* _What percentage of our users have iPhones?_ - with 20M users, we cover a statistically common group, so about one 40% have iPhones, 50% have Android devices, and 10% other. 
* _How about feature...?_ - accept everything and say that it's a good idea. Especially stuff that's messing up current business models (eg selling through Apple Pay etc).
* _Is it OK to start with a mobile web site?_ - it's up to them to propose a plan. The stakeholders want an iPhone app, but if they can convince you that a web site is better, then that's OK to propose.

The introduction shouldn't take more than five minutes, so the groups will have roughly 15 minutes to propose plans. About five minutes before the end, announce that they'll soon have to present, and ask them to write the plans down on flipcharts or post-its, so they can refer back to them later.

#### Discussion guidelines

If leading a smaller workshop, get individual groups to present their plans, but keep it quick and fluid so you can complete the review in 10 minutes. If people start explaining too much why they chose something, ask them to focus on the delivery plan, not the reasons behind it -- promise to come back to that later.

If leading a larger workshop, get people to walk around and look at the plans from other groups for five minutes, and then point out some key differences between the groups. 

Finish the discussion by pointing out at various similarities and differences between the plans.

### Exercise 2: Compare plans

This exercise continues directly on the first one, and forces people to think about what makes a good roadmap/delivery plan.

#### Facilitation goal

Create a list of arguments why proposed plans are good, so you can refer back to them later

#### Learning Objective

* Plans based on features are impossible to compare; anything can be justified when there are no clear objectives
* It's impossible to say whether any of the proposed plans are good or bad in isolation

#### Mechanics

Announce that, now that there are several plans, the business stakeholders can't decide which one to fund. The groups will get five minutes to prepare a one-minute explanation why their plan should be funded. 

Point out that you don't want them to repeat what's being proposed, just why it is better than the other plans -- now that everyone knows about all the plans, the groups should try to sell their plans, figure out what makes their particular plan the best.

In case of a large room, while the groups are discussing their plans, collect all the flipcharts/post-its with plans and move them to a central area where they could be easily observed. 

#### Discussion guidelines

After five minutes, get groups to sell their plans by taking turns. Before letting a group representative talk, go over to their plan, summarise it briefly, and let them sell it. Capture the key aspects they mention (eg low risk, focusing on key revenue streams..., quick) with post-its and stick next to their plans. Keep this brief and stop people if they try to go over what they plan to deliver again (this is quite common). 

After all the groups present, find conflicting arguments -- eg two groups claiming that their plan is low risk, but planning to do exactly the opposite things. Point out how it's almost impossible to compare those arguments, because there's too many, and different groups claim different benefits. Finish by talking how plans based on features are difficult to compare, and that anything can be justified with unverified claims.  

### Exercise 3: Brainstorm behaviour changes

Impacts -- especially behaviour changes -- are a critical concept for impact mapping, and most participants of your workshop probably do not normally think about them. This exercise helps people think about impacts first, so they can start differentiating between impacts, deliverables, types of work and organisational benefits. This falls into the "Concepts" part of training from the back of the room.

#### Learning objective

* Understand how to describe impacts
* Spot and avoid the most common problems when listing impacts (such as replacing them for deliverables or organisational goals)
* Understand that prioritising impacts is much easier than prioritising features -- because they can relate to the current business objectives
* Think about Now/Not Now prioritisation

#### Facilitation objective

* Get participants to brainstorm a list of impacts, so they can have a ready-made menu to kick start later impact mapping workshops
* Lead participants to selecting a business objective around advertising revenue

#### Mechanics

Introduce the new task: the participants should work in groups to identify as many behaviour changes as possible in 15 minutes, and write them on post-its with marker pens. This is a group exercise, and the participants should discuss ideas before noting them down. 

- The key is to identify whose behaviour we can impact, and what that impact is
- Show the behaviour change slide from the [Exercises](slides/exercises.ppt) presentation, explain the typical types of behaviour changes
- Point out that the participants don't need to worry too much about identifying exact numbers (so no need to write down "purchase 5% faster", "purchase faster" is OK). 
- Point out the difference between "purchase" as a behaviour, and "purchase faster" as an impact, and how there might be some other impacts such as "purchase more frequently", "purchase more expensive tickets" and so on.
- Ask the participants to use marker pens when writing ideas on post-its so they can be seen from a distance

During the group discussions, go around and look for typical mistakes

- People will list behaviours, not behaviour changes (eg "visit website"); get them to think about how differently
- People will list "start doing ..." when the users are already doing it, perhaps outside our software. Eg "start inviting friends to concerts". This is already happening in the real world, so the big question is "how differently"
- People will list software solutions (eg "start sending push notifications"); ask about whose behaviour they are changing with it instead

#### Discussion guidelines

Ask the participants to bring post-its to a central place - whiteboard or a wall. Let them cluster the ideas into groups, based on the user segment/actor. After the break, go through the major ideas, and try to identify some common mistakes (eg software ideas, types of work, overall organisational benefits). Discuss how those things are not easily measurable. Help the participants identify the underlying behaviour changes in the group discussion. 

Suggest that you can aim at achieving all those behaviour changes, but not everything is equally important. At the same time, if you can identify important behaviour changes, this will help with prioritisation. Ask the participants to review the business situation again -- users moving to mobile from desktop devices, and discuss what impacts would be important to address in such a change. Do a Now/Not Now prioritisation by crossing out anything not directly addressing the challenges of moving to mobile devices. 

Finally, discuss how addressing different impacts calls for completely different plans -- for example, choose some sales related impacts and ask the participants to suggest some important stories for that. Then select something around advertising or visiting frequently/visiting more, and ask them to suggest some stories for that.

### Exercise 4: Impact map for advertising revenue

In this exercise, the participants create their first impact map by bringing together deliverables under behaviour changes, and refining the plans. For a half-day session, this is the crucial part, falling into the 'Concrete practice' quadrant of 'Training from the back of the room'). 

#### Learning objective

* How thinking about impacts makes it easy to propose good deliverables
* How to create impact maps
* How to split stories using an impact map

#### Facilitation objectives

* Get groups to come up with alternatives to an iPhone app, that will help address the chosen business goal better
* Help participants think about splitting deliverables (stories) by actor segment or behaviour scale, instead of just by technology

#### Mechanics

- Say that, given all the options from the behaviour change list, the business stakeholders decided to focus first on solving problems with advertising. 
- Show the sixth slide from the [Exercises](slides/exercises.ppt) presentation ("We're getting a lot of customers from mobile phone browsers...")
- Given this particular problem, ask participants to draw up an impact map
- Hand out the [impact mapping cheat sheet](handouts/cheatsheet.doc) as a reminder for the structure
- Explain that the business problem on the projector is the goal in the centre of the impact map
- Ask them to ensure that any impacts they propose relate to that objective -- all other impacts fall into 'Not Now'
- Ask them to ensure that any deliverables they propose connect to a behaviour change relevant for the business objective -- all other deliverables fall into 'Not Now'

Go around the room, and help the participants define good impacts. Challenge things on their impact maps, by asking "How does this relate to the objective...", "How does this help this impact..." to force them to think harder.

The critical impacts that the participants should discover with your help are 'engage more frequently' (or any variant of that, such as 'come back more') and 'consume more content' (again, any variant is OK, such as 'view more pages', 'stay longer' etc). 

The key user segment they should discover are 'existing users with mobile devices'. This milestone is not yet about addressing new users, but let groups also propose ideas about that if they want, it will be useful for later discussion. 

Try to get the groups to discover these ideas on their own, by probing questions. Eg if they propose 'Use our iphone app', ask 'how does that help us protect advertising revenue on mobile?". Sometimes they'll need a few more probing questions to arrive to "come back more frequently" or "stay longer".

Here are some of the typical problem areas that the participants will need help with:

- People will mix deliverables and impacts. If you see a group doing that, ask them to think about impacts as something that other people do, and deliverables as something that 'we' (the delivery organisation) does. 
- People will suggest impact that are not behaviour changes. Use the ideas form the behaviour change brainstorming exercise to help them.
- People will suggest impacts that do not help the current objective (eg buying more...). Challenge them on this, and say that anything not directly related to improving advertising revenue is a 'Not Now' idea. 
- People will suggest deliverables that do not help an impact, and connect it to that. (Eg e-ticketing connected to helping users come back more frequently)
- People will often suggest a specific software solution on the impact level (eg 'use our iphone app'). Try to get them to think about what that actually achieves (eg engage more frequently).


#### Discussion guidelines

Compare key ideas of various solutions, especially focusing on all the various alternatives to writing an iPhone app. Some typical suggestions are a small mobile web site, rewriting the homepage to be more mobile friendly, rewriting a particular popular web site section (eg artist pages) to be more mobile friendly and so on.

Point out how the map structure makes it easy to prioritise Now/Not Now; compare that to typical MoSCoW prioritisation where 90% always ends up in the 'Must' category. Now/Not Now helps to avoid that problem, because everything can politically stay a good idea/must, just not the right idea for the current milestone.

Challenge the participants to think small. If someone proposed rewriting a mobile web site, say that this will be a few months of work. How would they slice that? 

Finally, show the slide on story splitting from the [Exercises](slides/exercises.ppt) presentation. Explain how an impact map helps to find smaller slices by allowing people to divide a segment of users (eg a mobile web site for one city) or a segment of change (eg instead of getting people to come back twice as often, do something that makes them come back 10% more often, or come back more often over the next month, that's already valuable).

Explain how those ways of splitting stories are often more useful than trying to divide by technical layers.  For example, limiting to one city, and only the next month or so of content, it may be possible to offer a static mobile web site and avoid any kind of integration challenges. Choose your most popular location, and this becomes incredibly valuable.

### Exercise 5: Propose new delivery plans

This is the final exercise of the half-day variant. In the full-day variant, this is a key learning point that helps the participants revisit the new ideas. In the Training from the back of the room terminology, this is in the 'Conclusions' quadrant.

#### Learning objectives

* How impact maps make prioritisation easy
* How impact maps help with dividing stories into smaller stories so that they are still valuable
* How plans based on impact maps are easy to compare, because they expose assumptions and provide focus (as opposed to being impossible to compare after the first exercise)

#### Facilitation objective

* Get groups to compare their new knowledge to the starting point of the workshop, where they also proposed plans

#### Mechanics

Ask the participants to propose a new release plan for 4-5 iterations, by considering the ideas from their impact maps.

- The business objective is still the same as before
- They should split large stories either by segment or scale of impact until each iteration delivers something clearly valuable
- It's OK to come up with new ideas based on the impact map, but they should make sure to focus on Now vs Not Now - prioritise one impact and deliver that first

#### Discussion guidelines

If leading a smaller workshop, get individual groups to present their plans, but keep it quick and fluid so you can complete the review in 10 minutes. 

If leading a larger workshop, get people to walk around and look at the plans from other groups for five minutes, and then point out some key differences between the groups. 

Compare the new plans to the plans proposed originally in the morning, and invite people to comment on their original arguments why their plans were good. Eg find a plan that was justified as 'focused' or 'quick' but actually spent most of the time on sales-related topics. 

Lead a discussion on how it's now possible to actually compare and evaluate plans. The context provided by the business objective in the centre of an impact map, plus the impacts that are directly related to that, helps people evaluate if something is a good plan and guide the delivery.

### Exercise 6: Impact map for call centre load

In a full-day variant, this is another exercise falling into the 'Concrete practice' quadrant in the 'Training from the back of the room' terminology. The previous impact mapping exercise (for advertising revenue) starts with a relatively concrete, and well defined goal, that helps with the prioritisation. In real-life situations, it's much more likely that people will start with vague, incorrect and misleading goal definitions, and part of the challenge is helping to refine the goal. 

This exercise gives the participants an experience of refining a goal. The original goal statement will be relatively precise, but misleading, and they need to discover the real goal. (but don't tell the participants that upfront).

This exercise is longer than the previous mapping exercises because it consists of two parts -- in the first part, the participants typically struggle with planning but discover that the goal is wrong. When several groups reach that conclusion, you can pause for a short discussion, redefine the goal, and let the groups continue working on a new goal. The first part should take no longer than 10-15 minutes with your guidance, so you're left with 5 minutes for a quick discussion session on the goal, and 20 minutes for the final mapping part.

#### Learning objectives

* Initial goal definitions often need refinement
* Concrete numbers help to refine goals
* Whenever a single part of the map is well defined, it helps to refine the concepts connected to it on both sides (so a well defined impact can help to refine both the intended deliverables and the goal statement)
* Sometimes software isn't the right solution, and business activities can also be proposed on impact maps if they create the same impact

#### Facilitation objectives

* Get at least a few groups challenge the initial goal statement in the first part
* Get at least one group to include business process changes (without any software changes) to their impact map in the second part

#### Mechanics

##### part 1

* Explain that maps help groups define deliverables based on goals, so the maps they created for advertising revenue would look completely differently if another goal was chosen
* Say that the advertising revenue plan went OK, and that the stakeholders decided that the next big thing is to deal with call centre load problems. Show slide 8 in the exercises presentation ('We want to reduce the load on our call centre...') and explain that large concerts often create a big problem for the call centre. For example, if the tickets for a large event start selling on Monday at 9AM, people might not be at home close to a desktop computer. If people are out of their home, they might try buying through the web browsers on their mobile phones, but the mobile internet is unreliable, and the site is all optimised for desktop work (Flash again..., menu navigation is cumbersome, shopping cart takes several steps...). Because the tickets tend to sell out quickly for important events, most fans will try to call the call centre instead, which creates massive problems. Long waiting queues build up, people calling about the popular event get angry because they wait and might miss out on tickets, and people calling about other things get angry because it just takes too long to reach us. 
* Point out that with big concerts like that we normally have an exclusive contract so we can't sell more tickets either way, but long queues prevent sales for other events at the same time and make people angry. Also, the call centre staff is under insane pressure during those times.
* If anyone asks for numbers, give numbers around event sizes and call centre processing times that would create a significant backlog in sales. Processing times are really important, but don't point those out specially, sandwich that in between some other numbers. For example:
  * popular concerts often have 10K-20K tickets
  * a single operator can sell one ticket every five minutes 
  * we have 300 call centre operators
* Ask the groups to create an impact map for that problem. Point again to the 'iPhone app' idea from the start, saying that one of the stakeholders is insisting that an iphone app with a quick buy button is the solution. The groups should create a map that either confirms that or proposes a viable alternative
* The participants should start with the information they know - the goal and the deliverable - and fill in the two missing levels in the map. After they've done that, they can propose alternatives, slice deliverables and so on
* Ask the groups to write with marker pens on flip charts so you can easily compare the maps
* DO NOT GIVE AWAY THAT THE GOAL NEEDS TO BE REFINED!
* go around and get the groups to define a good impact.
  * If they got stuck on slicing deliverables, point out that the impact is still missing and the groups should focus on defining that
  * If they defined an impact, challenge if that really helps to reduce call centre load. If not, they can either refine the goal or change the impact
  * If they define an impact as 'buy using iphone'/'buy using mobile phone' suggest that the users can already do that... they can call the call centre from their iphone/mobile phone; remind the groups that impacts are about behaviour changes, and ask them to define the behaviour change. 
* The impact that the groups should discover is 'buy using alternative channels' or 'buy more without calling the call centre', or 'buy tickets for peak events without calling the call centre'. Once they discover that impact, get them to think about the goal. Yes, this will help to reduce call centre load, but the easiest way to reduce load is to just turn off the call centre... Can they refine the goal? What else is missing that would disqualify shutting down the call centre as a solution? What other measurements are we missing?
* The goal the participants should discover is 'increase peak time sales', or 'increase capacity to sell at peak times', or 'sell more tickets per hour for large concerts'
* Once a few groups discover this (but before the entire room gets there), stop the group work and start a quick discussion on the goal. Ask people to shout out their goal definitions and again repeat the idea about shutting down the call centre -- if reducing the load is the real goal, that's an easy fix. What would be missing then? (ticket sales)

##### part 2

* Explain how concrete numbers often help to refine goals. Once some measurements are there, look for more measurements that would create good constraints for the solution. The load isn't really that important, as long as we can sell tickets quickly
* Agree on a concrete measurement for the goal. Eg, according to the original numbers, we can sell about 3600 tickets per hour at peak time through the call centre. We can sell significantly more through web, but people aren't using it. So one goal definition would be "increase peak time capacity by 5x"
* Get the groups to create new maps. Invite them to think about other actors or impacts
* Go around and help the groups refine their impacts
* Some interesting things that they need to discover are:
  * call centre operators could sell tickets faster
    * potential solutions for that are semi-automated sales workflows, selling tickets in batches (eg for a whole group at once) or shortening the average call time by revisiting the sales workflow
  * customers could buy tickets using many alternative channels
    * eg SMS
  * customers could buy tickets at different times
    * eg pre-register
* Ask the groups to come up with small deliverables by reducing the customer segment (eg for one big concert, for just one location, ...) or by reducing the scale of change (eg find something that helps call centre operators sells 20% faster, instead of 5000% faster immediately)
* Once a few groups have discovered those ideas (not necessarily a single group to discover all, it's even better if different groups discover different ideas), lead a final discussion on the solutions

#### Discussion guidelines

If leading a smaller workshop, get individual groups to present their plans, but keep it quick and fluid so you can complete the review in 10 minutes. 

If leading a larger workshop, get people to walk around and look at the plans from other groups for five minutes, and then point out some key differences between the groups. 

When talking about the call centre workflow changes, talk about the zone of control and the sphere of influence. If the call centre is 100% under the control of the group planning work, changes to the call centre are a deliverable. If the call centre is under the control of a different organisation, or even a department, those might be impacts, and we can propose things under our control that can impact that.

Point out at "sell tickets faster" and suggest that the call centre might be cross-selling things. In that case, just stopping cross-selling during peak times is a pretty good solution that helps immediately, and doesn't require any software changes.

Point out how it's now possible to evaluate proposed solutions against expected cost. Eg hiring more people for the call centre can solve the same problem. If we can't propose a software solution that is significantly cheaper, we should focus on building some other software instead and solve this as a HR problem. 

Point out how there are a lot of alternative solutions to an iPhone app (eg SMS purchases, or a separate web site for handling quick ticket sales on mobiles, with a link from the homepage during peak times).

# Facilitation guide

This guide explains how to facilitate the 'Concerts Online' impact mapping educational workshop. It is intended for consultants, trainers and team leaders that want to introduce impact mapping into an organisation. **This is not a guide for participants, and should not be shared with anyone apart from the facilitators**. See the [Logistics Guide](logistics-guide.md) for information regarding participant documents.

## Workshop variants

This workshop can run either as a half-day or a full-day session. The half-day variant is faster paced and better as a motivational session. The full-day variant allows for more discussion time and several additional exercises, so it provides more hands-on experience. You can run this workshop as a separate session, or include it into a larger workshop (for example, a two-day product owner course). If you decide to mix 'Concerts Online' with a larger workshop, it should come ideally after a session on determining business objectives/goals and before a session on detailed user stories or techniques to deal with individual backlog items.

The half-day session requires relatively punctual timing, especially for group discussions, so you'll have to drive the groups towards the right conclusions. The key points that the participants are supposed to reach are listed in the exercise guides. In the full-day variant you should let the discussions go on for longer, and may potentially remove the last exercise if the schedule slips. 

### Half-day guideline timings

For illustrative purposes, this assumes that the workshop starts at 9AM. Adjust accordingly for an afternoon session.

## Group considerations

The participants will work in groups, straight from the start. The ideal group size is 4-5 participants. Avoid larger groups as they tend to create too much internal discussion, and it's easy for some people to tune out in a larger group. Ideally, arrange for groups to contain people who do not typically work together - they are either from different teams or different organisations. For a half-day variant, let the people stay in the same group. That will save time and allow for closer groupwork. For the full-day variant, consider shuffling groups between exercises to allow for more varied opinions and break monotony. 

With less than 20 people in the room (so up to 3-4 groups), you can run discussion sessions by getting each group to present their work in turn. With more groups, this will take too much time. Instead of each group presenting, give people five minutes at the start of each discussion session to walk around the room and see the results produced by other groups, then lead the discussion by pointing out the key ideas on various solutions.

## Exercise guides

### Exercise 1: Initial Plans

This is a warm-up exercise. In the 'Training from the back of the room' terminology, it is a Connections-type exercise. The objective is give the participants a bit of time to form groups, connect their current knowledge to the problem, and learn about the exercise business domain. Also, the exercise helps to provide a baseline that you can use for comparison later, after the [Propose new delivery plans](#exercise-5-propose-new-delivery-plans) exercise.

#### Facilitation Goal

Get groups to create several different plans. 

#### Learning Objective

This exercise is a set-up for later exercises, there is no particular learning objective.

#### Mechanics

Start by explaining the purpose of the exercise. As far as the participants are concerned, _this is to provide a common baseline they can use for later comparison_. 

Next, introduce introducing the 'Concerts Online' company. You can show the first two slides from the [Exercises](slides/exercises.ppt) presentation while introducing the domain. Here are the key points to talk about:

* First slide
  * This is a successful business, with a horrible legacy system
  * We have cash and people to deliver software, but so far legacy rewrites ended up in a bin, as they could never catch up with the new system
  * The web site is optimised for desktop web browsers (eg lots of Flash), no longer providing a competitive advantage, moving too slowly
  * Unless we can respond to market changes quickly, one of our competitors will destroy us

* Second slide
  * The key user segment are teenagers/young adults, mostly using mobile devices and hanging out on social networks
  * Most of the money comes from selling tickets, second most important money source is advertising, then selling random merchandise related to concerts
  * We sell three types of tickets:
    * some are exclusive, eg a massively popular performer coming to London, we can negotiate an exclusive distribution deal to be the only site selling tickets (so we can't improve by selling more, but we can mess things up by not selling enough and losing exclusive deals) 
    * some are shared with other sales organisation (so the more we sell, the more money comes in)
    * some are self-service; smaller bands can set up a ticket sales channel through us via the events admin app, we take a profit cut. This is a relatively new, but very promising revenue stream for us.
  * The most popular content are artist pages. Eg Britney Spears page will have some videos, news, links to songs and upcoming concert info on Britney. For hugely popular artists, we have deals with their PR agencies posting content. For some small groups, they post it themselves. The parts in the middle are automatically generated from news feeds, content aggregators, web scraping and so on. This is also one of our key pieces of software, because it provides search engines with lots of material so they send us users.
  * The second most popular content are location pages (eg what's on in London tonight). For larger cities, we have content editors working on the materials. For smaller locations, our automated content systems do the work.

The last part (talking about sales percentages, revenue streams, popular pages) is important because it provides slight misdirection. The participants will wrongly assume that preserving the key business stream -- ticket sales -- is the critical thing in this and the next few exercises, which will provide a nice opportunity to discuss how bad assumptions about goals create problems for iterative delivery.

Now, introduce the challenge. You are the marketing director, and you just got the budget approval for a complete rewrite to support the business for the next 10 years. And naturally, it's going to be mobile. _Show the third slide_ -- the first order of business is to create an iPhone app. The groups are product management teams, and they need to propose the roadmap for building the app. We don't want to wait for two years to get something out, but instead want to deliver it iteratively. The teams should propose the plans for the next 4-5 iterations. Say that you will go around to answer any business questions they might have, but it's their responsibility to come up with a plan. _Switch to the second slide, showing the profit channels/customer breakdown_. 

When talking to the groups, do not address the entire room - answer questions only to individual groups. This will help groups create divergent plans. Avoid commenting on anything as good/bad. Explain that it's their job to propose the plans, and then they'll get a chance to compare them. Here are some of the most typical questions that the people will ask, and how to respond:

* _What's the most important thing for the business?_ - We have to migrate everything at some point, so everything is "most important", but you do not know how much they can deliver quickly, so it's up to them to propose a plan. If they insist on an answer, point them to the slide with revenue streams and say that starting anywhere with the key channels is good.
* _Why an iPhone app, why not Android?_ - So we can deliver iteratively; Android will be phase 2 once we have a successful iPhone app; People with iPhones spend more money through mobile phones. Our key stakeholders/managers all have iPhones.
* _What percentage of our users have iPhones?_ - with 20M users, we cover a statistically common group, so about one 40% have iPhones, 50% have Android devices, and 10% other. 
* _How about feature...?_ - accept everything and say that it's a good idea. Especially stuff that's messing up current business models (eg selling through Apple Pay etc).
* _Is it OK to start with a mobile web site?_ - it's up to them to propose a plan. The stakeholders want an iPhone app, but if they can convince you that a web site is better, then that's OK to propose.

The introduction shouldn't take more than five minutes, so the groups will have roughly 15 minutes to propose plans. About five minutes before the end, announce that they'll soon have to present, and ask them to write the plans down on flipcharts or post-its, so they can refer back to them later.

#### Discussion guidelines

If leading a smaller workshop, get individual groups to present their plans, but keep it quick and fluid so you can complete the review in 10 minutes. If people start explaining too much why they chose something, ask them to focus on the delivery plan, not the reasons behind it -- promise to come back to that later.

If leading a larger workshop, get people to walk around and look at the plans from other groups for five minutes, and then point out some key differences between the groups. 

Finish the discussion by pointing out at various similarities and differences between the plans.

### Exercise 2: Compare plans

This exercise continues directly on the first one, and forces people to think about what makes a good roadmap/delivery plan.

#### Facilitation goal

Create a list of arguments why proposed plans are good, so you can refer back to them later

#### Learning Objective

* Plans based on features are impossible to compare; anything can be justified when there are no clear objectives
* It's impossible to say whether any of the proposed plans are good or bad in isolation

#### Mechanics

Announce that, now that there are several plans, the business stakeholders can't decide which one to fund. The groups will get five minutes to prepare a one-minute explanation why their plan should be funded. 

Point out that you don't want them to repeat what's being proposed, just why it is better than the other plans -- now that everyone knows about all the plans, the groups should try to sell their plans, figure out what makes their particular plan the best.

In case of a large room, while the groups are discussing their plans, collect all the flipcharts/post-its with plans and move them to a central area where they could be easily observed. 

After five minutes, get groups to sell their plans by taking turns. Before letting a group representative talk, go over to their plan, summarise it briefly, and let them sell it. Capture the key aspects they mention (eg low risk, focusing on key revenue streams..., quick) with post-its and stick next to their plans. Keep this brief and stop people if they try to go over what they plan to deliver again (this is quite common). 

After all the groups present, find conflicting arguments -- eg two groups claiming that their plan is low risk, but planning to do exactly the opposite things. Point out how it's almost impossible to compare those arguments, because there's too many, and different groups claim different benefits. Finish by talking how plans based on features are difficult to compare, and that anything can be justified with unverified claims.  

### Exercise 3: Brainstorm behaviour changes

Impacts -- especially behaviour changes -- are a critical concept for impact mapping, and most participants of your workshop probably do not normally think about them. This exercise helps people think about impacts first, so they can start differentiating between impacts, deliverables, types of work and organisational benefits. 

#### Learning objective

* Understand how to describe impacts
* Spot and avoid the most common problems when listing impacts (such as replacing them for deliverables or organisational goals)
* Understand that prioritising impacts is much easier than prioritising features -- because they can relate to the current business objectives

#### Facilitation objective

* Get participants to brainstorm a list of impacts, so they can have a ready-made menu to kick start later impact mapping workshops
* Lead participants to selecting a business objective around advertising revenue

#### Mechanics

Introduce the new task: the participants should work in groups to identify as many behaviour changes as possible in 15 minutes, and write them on post-its with marker pens. This is a group exercise, and the participants should discuss ideas before noting them down. 

- The key is to identify whose behaviour we can impact, and what that impact is
- Show the behaviour change slide from the [Exercises](slides/exercises.ppt) presentation, explain the typical types of behaviour changes
- Point out that the participants don't need to worry too much about identifying exact numbers (so no need to write down "purchase 5% faster", "purchase faster" is OK). 
- Point out the difference between "purchase" as a behaviour, and "purchase faster" as an impact, and how there might be some other impacts such as "purchase more frequently", "purchase more expensive tickets" and so on.
- Ask the participants to use marker pens when writing ideas on post-its so they can be seen from a distance

During the group discussions, go around and look for typical mistakes

- People will list behaviours, not behaviour changes (eg "visit website"); get them to think about how differently
- People will list "start doing ..." when the users are already doing it, perhaps outside our software. Eg "start inviting friends to concerts". This is already happening in the real world, so the big question is "how differently"
- People will list software solutions (eg "start sending push notifications"); ask about whose behaviour they are changing with it instead

#### Discussion guidelines

Ask the participants to bring post-its to a central place - whiteboard or a wall - before taking the coffee break. Let them cluster the ideas into groups, based on the user segment/actor. After the break, go through the major ideas, and
try to identify some common mistakes (eg software ideas, types of work, overall organisational benefits). Discuss how those things are not easily measurable. Help the participants identify the underlying behaviour changes in the group discussion. 

Suggest that you can aim at achieving all those behaviour changes, but not everything is equally important. At the same time, if you can identify important behaviour changes, this will help with prioritisation. Ask the participants to review the business situation again -- users moving to mobile from desktop devices, and discuss what impacts would be important to address in such a change. Do a Now/Not Now prioritisation by crossing things out from the board -- anything not directly addressing that business change can be postponed. 

Finally, discuss how addressing different impacts calls for completely different plans -- for example, choose some sales related impacts and ask the participants to suggest some important stories for that. Then select something around advertising or visiting frequently/visiting more, and ask them to suggest some stories for that.
